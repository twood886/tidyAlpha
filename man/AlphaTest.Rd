}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe containing return column and factor value column}

\description{
Runs AT_sr_sf_sp for multiple periods
}
\details{
This function returns for the universe and each quantile for each period: \cr
      number of observations\cr
      average return\cr
      average relative return for quantiles\cr
      security level hit rate of universe vs 0\cr
      security level hit rate of universe vs universe average\cr
      information coefficient based on Z-Score of factor\cr
      information coefficient based on rank of factor\cr
      quantile spread between top and bottom quantile\cr
